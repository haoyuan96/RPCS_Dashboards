First please ensure that you are using Python3.
**********************************************
1. Dependencies you need to install.
pip3 install colored_traceback
pip3 install ipdb 
pip3 install sqlalchemy
(sudo apt-get install libpq-dev)
pip3 install psycopg2
    

[NOTE] If you cannot install psycopg2 directly, 
use this command:sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
before use pip3 to install psycopg2. 
[NOTE] If you fail to run pip3 install psycopg2,
try "pip3 install psycopg2-binary"

***********************************************
2. Then open the Dahboards folder, you will see some new files.
The "database" folder contains one file we need to read-----database.py
It contains all the functions we can use if we want to opearate on the data.

Genually, the code we need to write for fetching data from database:
db = getdb()
retrieved_accel = find_by_accel_id(db, accel_id)

[NOTE] Regarding to the ids(sensor id, patient id), this layer of connection will be hardcoded, we
have to talk with Infraustructure team to get consistency. At least it should be in a pattern of uuid.

***********************************************
3. Run the project.
After you finish you coding on the function call, then run normally on the Django project,
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver

*************************************************
4. Test on the code
(1) ssh to the AWS on our instance.
ssh -y ubuntu@ec2-3-20-245-112.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
password:samsuks

(2) log on our database.
sudo -u postgres -p HhmL0SWLuxPirhQO9dXD psql -h rpcs.cvsc3wzxbc5v.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com -p 5432 -d engine_db
password:HhmL0SWLuxPirhQO9dXD
[NOTE] our database name is:engine_db

(3) Common command we need to use:
SELECT * FROM <metric you want see, (specific metric can see from database.py)>
SELECT * FROM <metric you want see> WHERE <key = 'value'>

Example:
SELECT * FROM accels;
SELECT * FROM accels WHERE accel_id = '2e0d214c-7146-4e44-8e60-383adbd8941d';
[NOTE] Follow rules of SQL, anything you want to play with, please Google~
